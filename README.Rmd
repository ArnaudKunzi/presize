# presize
![travis](https://travis-ci.com/CTU-Bern/presize.svg?branch=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/CTU-Bern/presize/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/CTU-Bern/presize)

**Warning: R-package in development.**

The goal of presize is to provide functions for precision based sample size calculation. For a given sample size, the functions will return the precision (half the width of the confidence interval), and vice versa.

## Installation

You can install presize from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CTU-Bern/presize")
```

## Overview
presize will provide functions for

* descriptive statistics
    + mean (`prec_mean`)
    + proportion (`prec_prop`)
    + rate (`prec_rate`)
  
* absolute and relative differences
    + mean difference (`prec_meandiff`)
    + risk difference (`prec_riskdiff`)
    + odds ration (`prec_or`)
    + risk ratio (`prec_riskratio`)
    + rate ratio (`prec_rateratio`)
<!--    + hazard ratio -->
  
* correlation measures
    + correlation coefficient (`prec_cor`)
    + Cohens kappa (`prec_kappa`)
    + ICC (`prec_icc`)
    + limit of agreement from Bland Altman plot (`prec_lim_agree`)
  
* diagnostic measures
    + sens (`prec_sens`<sup>1</sup>)
    + spec (`prec_spec`<sup>1</sup>)
<!--    + positive LR -->
<!--    + negative LR -->
    + AUC (`prec_auc`)
    
<sup>1</sup> Simple wrappers for `prec_prop`.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(presize)

# calculate sample size for a proportion of 0.2, or 0.4 with a precision of 0.2
prec_prop(p = c(.2, .4), n = 10, method = "wilson")
```

THe problem being addressed is 'how wide is the confidence interval width given proportions of events of 20 and 40% and only 10 participants'.


## Shiny app

An online interactive version of the package is available [here](https://ctu-bern.shinyapps.io/presize). The app can also be launched locally via `launch_presize_app()` in RStudio.

## Funding

`presize` was largely developed at CTU Bern, with collaboration from CTU Basel. Funding was provided by the Swiss Clinical Trials Organisation.
